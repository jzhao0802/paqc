Welcome to paqc's documentation!
==================================

This is the data QC package of the Predictive Analytics Team within RWI.

This Python package was designed to perform and automate all the QC
steps we take when we receive a new or updated data file. This package was
designed to ensure consistent data quality across projects and minimise the
effort spent on manual data QC, by automating most of our standard data checking
 procedures in the form of pre-compiled list of tests.
